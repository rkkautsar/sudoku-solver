# SAT-based Sudoku Solver

A rewrite of a side project: https://github.com/rkkautsar/sudoku-solver-nim

## Description

A general n &times; n Sudoku solver that works by encoding the constraints to SAT and use SAT solver to solve it.

Featuring:

- accepts n &times; n sudoku input (either multiline or one line for 9x9 sudoku)
- can print out the CNF encoding only
- has built-in SAT solver (gophersat) or can use custom SAT solver
- bimander encoding for at-most-one
- parallel CNF encoding
- fast, but not as fast as specialized solvers (1.8ms for ai-escargot, naÃ¯ve backtracking is around 30ms)
- pretty fast for larger sudokus (with custom state of the art SAT solver like cadical, 144x144 took 20s, may be better if using parallel SAT solvers)
- pretty simple code

## Benchmarks

About 51.5s (954 puzzle/s) to solve the benchmark of [49k 17-clue 9x9 sudoku](data/sudoku.many.17clue.txt) from here: https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/190727/the-fastest-sudoku-solver

Fastest on this benchmark is [tdoku](https://www.github.com/t-dillon/tdoku) which took 0.2s to complete :rocket:. Other SAT-based solver with minisat took 11.7s.
